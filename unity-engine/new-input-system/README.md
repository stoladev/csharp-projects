# Unity's New Input System

This is a great starter group of scripts to make use of Unity's new input
system that is superior to the old one in every way. It certainly takes some
getting used to, and documentation must be read (even though it is currently
sparse - they say that they're working on it). 

## What's Included?

- X-Y-Z movement with any typical input imagineable (WASD, arrow keys,
  controller joypad/joystick, touchscreen joypad/joystick)
- A camera that follows the player in a fixed position when moving.
